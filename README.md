# Intersection-Traffic-Simulation
>The machine problem is a one-way Intersection Traffic Simulation that makes use of a Queue Data Structure. The car’s interval is set to 2 seconds. In every successful program run, the traffic light in the left road goes on green first then it will be followed by the stoplight in the down road. Once the traffic light on the down road turns red, the traffic light on the left road will go green again. Thus, the program does not end, or the cars’ movements and the traffic lights’ timers will continue to run, unless the user exits the console. Only one traffic light can go green at a certain time, the other traffic light is on red. Once a traffic light goes on green, the cars on the specified road will increase in number adding up to the queue otherwise, it will decrease in number decrementing the queue. 
## Basic Functionalities of the Address Book
>1.	Add Contact
>2.	Edit Contact
>3.	Delete Contact
>4.	View Contacts with sort and search functionality  
>5.	Load Contacts via batch file
>6.	Logs functionality
## Prerequisites
>1. Oracle VM VirtualBox
>2. Ubuntu ISO file
### Execution of the Machine Problem Address Book program
>1.	Open the terminal on the virtual machine and extract the JAWOD_MP.tar.gz on the home directory with the tar command. 
>2.	Once extracted, change current directory to the extracted folder from the home directory named JAWOD_MP.
>3.	Change location of the PATH variable.
>4.	Apply executable permissions on each script files.
>5.	Run the mp.bash file to execute the program.
