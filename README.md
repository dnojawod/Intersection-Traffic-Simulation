# Intersection-Traffic-Simulation
>The machine problem is a one-way Intersection Traffic Simulation that makes use of a Queue Data Structure. The car’s interval is set to 2 seconds. In every successful program run, the traffic light in the left road goes on green first then it will be followed by the stoplight in the down road. Once the traffic light on the down road turns red, the traffic light on the left road will go green again. Thus, the program does not end, or the cars’ movements and the traffic lights’ timers will continue to run, unless the user exits the console. Only one traffic light can go green at a certain time, the other traffic light is on red. Once a traffic light goes on green, the cars on the specified road will increase in number adding up to the queue otherwise, it will decrease in number decrementing the queue. 
## Prerequisites
>1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or later
### Execution of the Intersection Traffic Simulation
>1. Download the "traffic4" File
>2. Open Visual Studio application and execute program solution.
>3. Build and run the program.
>4. Once the program runs, it will simulate a one-way intersection traffic simulation and will prompt the user to continue with (Y/N) when the program concludes one complete simulation.
